# SRED: Secure and Robust Emotion Detection for ADAS

This repository contains the implementation of **SRED**, a Secure and Robust Emotion Detection framework designed for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The system detects driver emotions from facial images while defending against adversarial attacks.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Facial emotion recognition is critical in monitoring driver states in ADAS. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples that can mislead emotion prediction. This project implements a hybrid defense strategy combining **attention masking** and **adversarial training** to improve robustness against such attacks.

## 🧰 Features

- Face detection using **MTCNN**
- Emotion classification using:
  - ResNet18
  - MobileNetV2
  - EfficientNetB0
- Attention masking for facial region enhancement
- Adversarial training using **FGSM**
- Robustness evaluation under **FGSM**, **BIM**, and **PGD** attacks
- Saliency map visualization
- Evaluation on **KMU-FED**, **KDEF**, and **FER2013** datasets
