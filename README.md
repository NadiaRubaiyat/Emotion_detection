# SRED: Secure and Robust Emotion Detection for ADAS

This repository contains the implementation of **SRED**, a Secure and Robust Emotion Detection framework designed for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The system detects driver emotions from facial images while defending against adversarial attacks.

## üîç Project Overview

Facial emotion recognition is critical in monitoring driver states in ADAS. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples that can mislead emotion prediction. This project implements a hybrid defense strategy combining **attention masking** and **adversarial training** to improve robustness against such attacks.

## üß∞ Features

- Face detection using **MTCNN**
- Emotion classification using:
  - ResNet18
  - MobileNetV2
  - EfficientNetB0
- Attention masking for facial region enhancement
- Adversarial training using **FGSM**
- Robustness evaluation under **FGSM**, **BIM**, and **PGD** attacks
- Saliency map visualization
- Evaluation on **KMU-FED**, **KDEF**, and **FER2013** datasets
